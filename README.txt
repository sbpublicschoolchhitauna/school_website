Updated site package
- index.html has been updated to handle video files in the slider.
- New injected script replaces or appends improved createSlides, adjustHeightTo and goTo functions.
- slider_videos/ contains README explaining where to put your mp4 files.
- Original index.html backed up as index.html.bak in the original /mnt/data location.

To use:
- Put your mp4 in slider_videos/ with the exact name referenced in the IMAGES array inside index.html.
- Upload entire folder to your server preserving paths, or test locally with a simple static server.
